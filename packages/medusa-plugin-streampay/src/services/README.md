### How to Use Payment Capture Logic

The payment capture logic in our project allows to authorize and capture payments using the Solana blockchain. Follow these steps to implement the logic in application:

#### Step 1: Initialize Solana Web3.js

In this step, initialize Solana Web3.js to connect to the Solana blockchain network. You'll need to specify the Solana RPC endpoint.

```javascript
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

// Initialize the connection to the Solana network
const connection = new Connection('https://solana-mainnet.solana.com');
```

#### Step 2: Authorize Payment

Before capturing a payment, you need to authorize it. This involves creating a Solana transaction that locks the payment amount. You'll need the seller's public key, the receiver's public key, and the payment amount in lamports (Solana's smallest unit of currency).

```javascript
const { Transaction, SystemProgram } = require('@solana/web3.js');

// Create a Solana transaction to lock the payment amount
const transaction = new Transaction().add(
  SystemProgram.transfer({
    fromPubkey: sellerPublicKey, // Seller's public key
    toPubkey: receiverPublicKey, // Receiver's public key
    lamports: paymentAmount, // Payment amount in lamports
  })
);

// Sign and send the transaction
const signature = await connection.sendTransaction(
  transaction,
  [sellerWallet], // Seller's wallet for signing
  {
    skipPreflight: false,
  }
);
```

#### Step 3: Capture Payment

Once the payment is authorized, you can capture it by confirming the authorized transaction. This step verifies that the payment has been successfully captured.

```javascript
// Retrieve the authorized transaction signature
const { transactionSignature } = paymentSessionData;

// Confirm the authorized transaction
const confirmation = await connection.confirmTransaction(transactionSignature);

// Check if the confirmation was successful
if (confirmation.value?.err) {
  console.error("Payment capture failed:", confirmation.value.err);
  // Handle the error
} else {
  // Payment has been successfully captured
  console.log("Payment captured successfully");
}
```

Please note that this is a simplified example, and you should adapt it to your specific use case, integrate your Solana wallet, and handle errors and validations as needed. Additionally, ensure that you have the required Solana libraries and dependencies installed in your project.
